A script that checks the status of EBS volumes, and if it finds volumes in the Available status, it pushes the custom metric 'CustomMetric/EBSVolumes' to AWS CloudWatch, on the basis of which you can create an alert in Prometheus.
Sometimes you need to make an exception, and this is implemented in this script.
Just add the suffix "DONT_DELETE" to the Name tag of the corresponding EBS volume to skip such a volume.
